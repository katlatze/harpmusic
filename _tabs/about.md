<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i> Me</h3>

Hi! I go by Valfreyja online, and I'm a lever harp player from Canada. I really love video game music, and it was a struggle trying to play from piano sheets that didn't take the harp's diatonic nature into consideration. In 2024, I finally learned how to read sheet music with some proficiency and learned to make my own arrangements.

<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i> My Scores</h3>

My scores are nearly always based on sheet music arranged by other people, and you will find the original arrangers credited in my files where applicable. From these original sources of inspiration I adjust accompaniments to make them more harp-friendly, add lever flip markings where necessary, simplify things, etc. I'm still learning, so my scores are always improving. Let me know in the comments if you find any errors (like both hands playing the same note, or notes that need a lever flip that I missed).

Most of my scores are designed for **34-string lever harps ranging from C2-A6**. Some songs may be playable on harps with less strings - check the `26_string` tag for songs that can be played on a 26-string lap harp such as a Harpsicle.

In terms of difficulty, I aim for an **"early intermediate"** level of playing. Sometimes I will leave in fast/difficult LH accompaniments, but these can almost always be simplified by the player to "1-5-8s" (or even just octaves, or a single bass note). I always aim to arrange for the lowest number of lever changes possible.

I generally leave out dynamics markings in my sheet music, and I encourage anyone who plays my sheets to adapt them freely to your own preferences. Play around with the accompaniment, change the octave of some sections, introduce your own dynamics... etc!

I offer the original musescore files so you can listen to them and make your own adjustments. **You are welcome to use my scores for anything non-commercial. If you record them I would LOVE to see.**
