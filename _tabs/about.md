<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i> Me</h3>

Hi! I go by Valfreyja online, and I'm a lever harp player from Canada that started creating harp arrangements in 2024. I really love video game music, and it was a struggle trying to play from piano sheets that didn't take the harp's diatonic nature into consideration. In 2024, I finally learned how to read sheet music with some proficiency and learned to make my own arrangements.

<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i> My Scores</h3>

My scores are nearly always based on sheet music arranged by other people, and you will find the original arrangers credited in my files where applicable. From these original sources of inspiration I adjust accompaniments to make them more harp-friendly, add lever flip markings where necessary (symbolized by a â¬¦ in the score), simplify things, etc.

All of my scores are designed for 34-string+ lever harps ranging from C2-A6. Some songs may be playable on harps with less strings - I'll aim to write the note range on each page. I will sometimes lower sections by an octave in my arrangements to avoid the very high strings (personal preference). 

In terms of difficulty, I aim for an "early intermediate" level of playing. Sometimes I will leave in fast/difficult LH accompaniments, but these can almost always be simplified by the player to "1-5-8s" (or even just octaves, or a single bass note).

I generally leave out dynamics markings in my sheet music, and I encourage anyone who plays my sheets to adapt them freely to your own preferences. Play around with the accompaniment, change the octave of some sections, introduce your own dynamics... etc!

I offer the original musescore files so you can listen to them and make your own adjustments. You are welcome to use my scores for anything non-commercial. If you record them I would LOVE to see. 

If you're enjoying my work and you'd like to leave a donation, I have a Ko-fi page set up here:

Thanks for visiting, and happy harping!!
