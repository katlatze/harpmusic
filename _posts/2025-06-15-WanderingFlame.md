This one is a transcription of Harpsibored's beautiful harp arrangement of this song, posted here with permission. From what I can tell, this is one of TWO songs in FFX (My favourite Final Fantasy) that are fully diatonic, with the other being the Hymn of the Fayth (I have an arrangement of that one in the works that will be done "eventually"). Every other FFX song I've tried to arrange for lever harp has been a huge struggle, so I was super excited for this one!!
