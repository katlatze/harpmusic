A member of the Harps Unite discord server showed me that this had been done on lever harp before, so I had to try arranging it! It came out good, but there's a slightly tricky part in bars 27-28 where you need to play C-C# in quick succession. I've removed all the accompaniment at that part so LH can just focus on flipping that lever.
