Any major fan of Dark Souls eventually finds Berserk, and this song. I haven't tested the B section yet and I think it will be tough, but the left hand can be simplified to play less notes. I've also transposed the song to F because I don't like having to play with literally every lever up. You can play this on a 26-string by playing everything one octave higher!
