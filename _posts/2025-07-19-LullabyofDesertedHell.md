I don't know much about Touhou, but I found (https://www.mariannebouvettemusic.com/)[Marianne Bouvette] playing part of this song on Youtube and I fell in love! I've transposed the song from the original F dorian (4 sharps) to G dorian to be more harp-friendly. Additionally, the original song has a keychange section that wasn't going to work for lever harp, so what I've done is just repeat the 18-bar basic melody twice with different accompaniment, and then finished with a little ending. 

You can play this on a lap harp that has a high "A" string, but unfortunately this arrangement in G dorian is not Harpsicle-friendly. Feel free to use the musescore file to transpose it to any key you like!
