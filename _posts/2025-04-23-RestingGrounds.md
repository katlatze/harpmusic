Another beautiful emotional track from Hollow Knight. This one has a particularly tricky lever change right between a C# (masquerading as a D♭) and a C♮, which I haven't tested yet but I imagine you'll need to mute the string immediately after playing and flip the lever while muted. Worst case, you can leave out one of the two notes (probably the C♮ because at least there's a melody playing over it).
