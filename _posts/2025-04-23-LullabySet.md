This is an absolute behemoth at 223 bars, and one of the first songs I ever arranged for lever harp back when I got my first harp. It has a very special place in my heart and I will eventually re-learn it enough to get a video recorded. This one I meticulously arranged by ear, and it is in my opinion a very faithful rendition of this beautiful song. 

This song is very harp-friendly until you hit bar 188, but it's split up into lots of little segments so it's easy to just pick a few and play those and skip the end. The chorus especially is super fun to play on harp! It also perfectly fits on a 26-string as I originally arranged it for my 26-string Harpsicle: just play the whole song up one octave.
