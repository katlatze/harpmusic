A beautiful relaxing song from Twilight Princess that I love - unfortunately, _YOU_ will not feel relaxed as you navigate 6 lever changes on strings that are still ringing out. If I ever come up with a better idea for this song, I'll upload it here, but these Zelda songs are rough on lever harp.

For some good news, this song only requires 3 octaves, so it could be played on a 26-string harp if you play everything up one octave!
